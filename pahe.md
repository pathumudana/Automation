# Lab 1: Installing Git

## Linux

Virtually every distribution of Linux includes Git in its repositories. Here are the commands for some of the most common Linux distributions:

For Debian and Ubuntu: `sudo apt install git-all` (this _should_ work for the various Ubuntu derivatives like Linux Mint as well)

For Fedora: `sudo dnf install git-all`

For CentOS: `sudo yum install git-all` (this _should_ also work for RHEL)

## macOS

The easiest way to install Git on macOS is to install it as part of the XCode Command Line Tools:

1. Navigate to [https://developer.apple.com/downloads/more/](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/more/) and log in with your Apple ID. (Membership is free.)

2. Download the latest version of Command Line Tools for your version of macOS (the name of the download usually indicates the macOS version support).

3. Install the downloaded package. Git will be available from your terminal after the installation.

If you'd prefer not to go this route, a Mac OS X binary installer is available at [https://git-scm.com/download/mac](https://git-scm.com/download/mac).

## Windows

Download the installer executable from [https://git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win) to install Git on your Windows-based system.
